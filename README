Subtitles 
=========

Movie files can be viewed with subtitles, which are currently 
very popular as text files. The command line tool 'subs' and 
its perl backend Subtitles.pm provide means for simple loading, 
re-timing, converting, and storing these subtitle files. 
Supported formats are .srt, .sub, .smi, and .idx. It can easily be extended. 


The module supports .srt, .sub, .smi, and .idx subtitle formats.

USAGE
=====

Warning: -i is a great feature, but use it with certain caution.

If subtitles are shown too early ( 5 seconds):

   subs -i -b 5 file.sub

If subtitles are for a movie in 25 fps, need to be for 24
( actual for frame-based formats only ).

   subs -i -a 24/25 file.sub

If subtitles start 1 second too early, but in 1 hour are late in 7 seconds:

   subs -i -p 0 -1 -p 1:00:00 +7 file.sub

Join two parts with 15-second gap
  
    subs -o joined.sub -j 15 part1.sub part2.sub 

Split in two after 50 minutes and half a second ( makes basename.1.sub
and basename.2.sub ).

    subs -o basename.sub -s 50:00.5 toobig.sub

Remove closed caption-specific comments such as '[Sneezing]' or '[Music playing]'

    subs -e 's/[\s-]*\[.*\]\s*\n*//gs' sub.sub
